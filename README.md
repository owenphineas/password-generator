# Password Generator Starter Code

## Description
This is an application that generates random passwords. Users can select the length of the password and the types of characters that the password must include, and the application will generate a string matching that criteria. Passwords can range between 8 and 128 characters, and can include lowercase letters, uppercase letters, numerals, and special characters. The purpose of the application is to help users generate strong, secure passwords easily. Long, randomized passwords are harder to guess and therefore more secure. Many websites require that passwords be a certain minimum length, and include certain character types. This application can generate passwords that fit that criteria.

## Usage
Users can click Generate Password upon loading the page, which will make the criteria appear. They can then select the character types that must be included in the password and the desired length. At least one character type must be selected and the length must be a number between 8 and 128. Once a password is generated, users can simply copy and paste the string that appears in the box for their own personal use.
